## Block-wise Gibbs Sampling using 

## Abstract

To make a parsimonious model when initially having a large number of predictors, it is inevitable to identify the best subset of such predictors. In this case, a spike-and-slab prior facilitates an efficient Gibbs sampling by shrinking the parameter estimates with the mixture of two prior distributions. To implement far more efficient sampling, we introduced a block-wise updating approach to the beta coefficient. In the end, we found that our Gibbs sampling code reduced the running timeâ€™s of general Gibbs sampling. Also, it was faster than the Gibbs sampling without the block-wise updating approach approximately two- thirds(2/3).

## Usage

Block-wise Gibbs sampling can be useful when there are a lot of covariates. This blockwise Gibbs sampling method is from a model, called spike and slab model (eq.(2)) in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0505633.pdf" target="_blank">Spike and Slab Variable Selection: Frequentist and Bayesian Strategies.</a>
